Sphinx introduction
*******************

`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_ documentation tool is briefly introduced in this section.

Sphinx doc is written with `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (reST) markup language. 
reST is a `lightweight markup language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language>`_.

Advantages of documentation with reST - Sphinx:

* Clean markup, raw plain text is also readable, instead of the sophisticated markup language, like HTML and LaTeX.
* Managable for structured, large documentations, *i.e.* write books.
* Supporting locally output form: html, pdf, epub ... with Sphinx.
* Web hosted, https://readthedocs.org/, load the raw text from Github, for collaborative documentation writing.

some useful online resources:

* Sphinx `official documentation <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_. 
  Especially the **short introduction of reST markup**, http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html.
* The `rest-sphinx-memo doc <http://rest-sphinx-memo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_, for the very detailed markup examples.
* The Sphinx doc hosting site, `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_, 
  and it's `documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
